    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Cashback will only be ‘tracked’ if you visit the retailer site directly from the cashback link on our website as linking from an advert or sponsored link may or may not activate the cashback.

  </data>
  <data name="Member_11" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Navigating away from our website to a third-party site or failure to complete the transaction in full at the time of linking from Exclusive Rewards website may also interrupt the transaction link and may result in cashback not being applied.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Member_12" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There are certain rules and levels of cashback which may vary even via a single partner company and we recommend that you read the terms and conditions of each individual cashback offer to be fully aware of what cashback you will receive.  For example, a company may be paying different levels of cashback on furniture than they do on clothing or although unusual, it may be that certain companies will only offer cashback on your first purchase from them so please be aware that you should fully understand what you will receive before making your purchase.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Member_13" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You must be logged into your Exclusive Rewards account to make a link work and receive cashback.  Cashback payments are at the retailer’s discretion, at all times, and we will not be liable if a retailer deems a transaction to not have qualified for cashback for any reason.</value>

    <value>If you close your account and the threshold for withdrawal has not been reached and therefore you are unable to withdraw the cashback then again, the cashback in the account will be forfeited.

  <data name="Member_16" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In the event of expected cashback not being paid to you by a retailer we will endeavour to follow up your claim and try to correct the problem with the retailer or give you a valid reason why the cashback was not paid to you.  It is important to understand that Exclusive Media Limited are not liable to you for any unpaid cashback and the retailer decision on whether to pay is final. If we do not receive the cashback from the retailer we cannot and will not be able to pay the cashback to you. Once again, we will do our best to resolve any dispute or error, but we cannot be responsible to pay you at any time for unpaid cashback by a retailer.</value>

    <value>It is very important to understand the ownership of the cashback.

All monies are held on deposit by us until the point at which you take legal possession and entitlement to the cashback which is at the point of a successful withdrawal from your Exclusive Rewards account or the transfer of such cashback into an investment vehicle, that has been linked to the cashback account.</value>

    <value>How To Claim Your Cashback</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Member_22" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Claiming your cashback is very simple and is activated via the account section of your Exclusive Rewards membership. There are some very simple rules to follow.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Member_23" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Once your cashback has reached the ‘received’ status on your account, you may withdraw your cashback at any time by simply requesting a withdrawal to your chosen bank account from your Exclusive Rewards account page. You may withdraw all or part of your balance at any time, but the minimum withdrawal amount is £5.00.  Cashback is not available for withdrawal until the minimum threshold for withdrawal of £5.00 has been reached in your received balance on your account page.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Member_24" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If your account is a benefit rewards account where a percentage of your cashback earned is being donated to a beneficiary, you do not need to activate the separate donation balance. This will be automatically recorded and transferred directly to your beneficiary. Your beneficiary will receive the full donation balance with no charge for administration, resulting in 100% of the donated balance for the beneficiary. There is no minimum threshold for transfer to your beneficiary and your current available donation will be made to your beneficiary on an agreed basis with your beneficiary. This will be on a monthly or quarterly basis. The donated balance on the account page will continue as an accrued value of all donations made to your beneficiary.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Member_25" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You must ensure that the details of your chosen bank account are entered correctly as payment into an incorrect account will not be our responsibility. Any payment made incorrectly due to the wrong information being submitted may not be recoverable but even if they are, will almost certainly be subject to fees for recovery. We are not liable for any delays in you receiving your cashback.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Member_26" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The period from withdrawal of cashback to the funds reaching your chosen bank account is not the responsibility of {{Name}} as this is dictated by the normal procedure of the payable method. We recommend that you allow between 2-5 working days for your cashback to arrive in your selected bank account.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Member_27" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Investment Account (If Selected)</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Member_28" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Your Exclusive Rewards is invested for you directly into a GIA (General Investment Account). This means that when the cashback received and cleared into your Exclusive Rewards Account reaches for the first time a threshold of £10.00, it will immediately activate an account administered by an FCA regulated asset management company and your cashback will be transferred by us on your behalf.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Member_29" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Your cashback will then be invested in various investment models such as stocks and shares enabling anticipated growth of your funds with no input from yourself.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Member_3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When shopping with Exclusive Rewards in a shopping centre we always recommend that you review the terms and conditions relating to the deal on our website as there may be exclusions and instructions of how to obtain the agreed discounts and we recommend that you always check all of our deals for any exclusions that may affect your expectations.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Member_30" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Your cashback balance remains visible and available for you to withdraw at any time in full or a part thereof by simply clicking the withdrawal button on your account.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Member_31" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When a withdrawal is activated your selected withdrawal amount will be returned to your Exclusive Rewards account for instant repayment to your chosen bank account.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Member_32" xml:space="preserve">

  <data name="Member_5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When shopping on-line, Exclusive Rewards allows you to take advantage of thousands of exclusive promotional codes enabling you to save money when making purchases on-line. We are a closed group membership that means only by logging in to your Exclusive Rewards account will you be able to see the voucher codes and promo codes to be used when shopping on our partner company websites, so we therefore recommend that you immediately log in to your account as soon as you visit the website or mobile application. We work with some of the biggest companies and our deals may be permanent on-going savings each time you use a particular company website or may be shorter deals that last for weeks or months or may even be flash deals that we are able to bring to you on a daily or weekly basis. We must state that all voucher codes and promotional codes promoted via Exclusive Rewards website or mobile application are provided to us by our partner companies and we give no guarantee that they are always current or valid. We do our best, on a daily basis, to ensure that all codes are active and working but errors can be made and so we are not liable in any way if a voucher codes fails to apply an expected or advertised saving.</value>

    <value>Cashback</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Member_7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Your Exclusive Rewards membership also allows you to obtain Cashback on almost everything you buy on-line that is linked by simply going through the Exclusive Rewards website. We are dealing on-line with many thousands of the country’s and world’s best-known retailers and this will save our regular users hundreds, potentially even thousands of pounds per year. For us to bring you and for you to use this incredible feature we do need to make you fully aware of how Cashback functions.</value>

    <value>How To Earn Cashback</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Member_9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>All of the cashback that you are about to earn by using your Exclusive Rewards membership is a transaction that you will make directly with the retailer website and not actually through us. We are just making it happen for you.  The retailer will know who you are because of your account with us and certain tracking links that our website provides to identify you and all the purchases that you make and to provide the cashback.  Within a short period of your purchase being completed you will see in your Exclusive Rewards account as ‘pending’ the cashback earned from the transaction. Once the retailer validates the purchase and has paid the commission to us it is now available to you and will show as an available balance in your Exclusive Rewards account. This can take a period of time due to administration but also due to legal positions such as cooling off periods that may allow you to cancel a transaction or return goods that are not required for a refund. A typical period before cashback is available to withdraw in accordance with our pay out terms and conditions is around 30-60 days, but this can be longer or shorter and is fully dependent on the retailer and not us. By using our website and the cashback elements of it you must agree that, in order for us to track and confirm your purchase, it is necessary for the affiliate networks to share an order ID with us relating to your purchase.</value>

    <value>Members of Exclusive Rewards benefit from many different money-saving options that may or may not be able to be used in conjunction with each other.  All our partner companies have individual rules relating to the combined use of various offers and we suggest strongly that the terms and conditions of each of our offers are read prior to making any on-line purchase or using your Exclusive Card in the high street. We offer thousands of deals on our website and endeavour to keep all our deals up to date and accurate. However, we can accept no responsibility for any inaccuracies or expired deals or promotional codes that no longer work.</value>

    <value>We also offer cashback on almost all your on-line purchases. We state almost all, as on some occasions, cashback may for example be only available on your first purchase from a partner company or for example a company may not allow a promo code to be used in conjunction with a cashback facility. As stated before, we are governed by the terms and conditions of our partner companies, but it is our intention to make as many savings as possible for our members.  These occasions are not the general rule and you should, in most cases be able to obtain cashback or the combined use of voucher codes and cashback potentially saving you hundreds or even thousands of pounds per year.</value>

  <data name="Diamond_3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Any liability or loss incurred when using the services of our third-party partners will be covered in the same way as those specified in clause 4 of our terms and conditions titled 'Liability'.

    <value>The upgrade package is for a 12-month period and is automatically renewed after 12 months to continue access to the additional benefits. The upgrade package can be cancelled at anytime but no refund will be made for any remaining period of the 12-month membership. If the upgrade membership is not renewed or is cancelled, membership will revert to standard lifetime membership and all accrued cashback or investment is still available in the account. The account will continue to operate, as a standard account without the benefits of the upgrade package.</value>

    <value>If a diamond membership package is provided by an employer (or other third party) to the employees then the individual employee will benefit from all the additional benefits of the upgraded account for the period that the employer continues to be contracted with Exclusive Media Limited for the upgraded account. If at any time the employer terminates or decides to no longer provide the upgraded account option to the individual employees, then the Exclusive Rewards account will revert to a standard membership and all accrued cashback or investment will still be available to the individual employee. The additional benefits will however no longer be available to the individual employee. The individual employee would have the option to upgrade their account on an ongoing basis if they so wish at the advertised price displayed on the Exclusive Rewards website.</value>

    <value>Exclusive Media Limited has a relationship with each of our third-party providers for the additional benefits offered within the diamond package and will endeavour to retain each partner on an on-going basis. Exclusive Media Limited cannot however be held responsible for the withdrawal at any time of any benefit made available to us and included in the diamond package within the period of any membership. No refund will be offered at any time in the case of removal of an offer by any of our third-party partners, but members will have the choice whether to continue the diamond membership for the following year, at the time of renewal.</value>
